            When the humid shadows hover<br>
            Over all the starry spheres<br>
            And the melancholy darkness<br>
            Gently weeps in rainy tears,<br>
            What a bliss to press the pillow<br>
            Of a cottage-chamber bed<br>
            And lie listening to the patter<br>
            Of the soft rain overhead!<br>
            Every tinkle on the shingles<br>
            Has an echo in the heart;<br>
            And a thousand dreamy fancies<br>
            Into busy being start,<br>
            And a thousand recollections<br>
            Weave their air-threads into woof,<br>
            As I listen to the patter<br>
            Of the rain upon the roof.<br>
            Now in memory comes my mother,<br>
            As she used in years agone,<br>
            To regard the darling dreamers<br>
            Ere she left them till the dawn:<br>
            O! I feel her fond look on me<br>
            As I list to this refrain<br>
            Which is played upon the shingles<br>
            By the patter of the rain.
